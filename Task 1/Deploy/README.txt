To RUN
Run 'TextStats.exe'

you may need to build it yourself from the source code because of signing and secruity prompts.
To do this launch 'TextStats.sln' in the source code directory to open the software in visual studios,
you can then select release and build, and you can find the application in the bin directory.
You could alternatively have debug selected and press build and run for it to instantly start.

In visual studios code clicking MainForm.cs might bring up a designer window, to see the code below, press f7.
